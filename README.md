AccountoriaAccountoria is a sophisticated, full-cycle web application designed to manage financial records through a double-entry accounting system. Built with a "Chic & Futuristic" aesthetic, it serves as a centralized "financial intelligence" hub that automates the relationship between raw journal entries and high-level financial health indicators.✨ Core Mechanics & Features1. The Financial EngineThe heart of the project is the generate_financials() function, which acts as an automated accountant:Ledger Processing: Automatically iterates through every journal entry to identify account types (Asset, Liability, Equity, Revenue, or Expense) and calculates running balances based on standard debit/credit rules.Balance Validation: Continuously tracks the fundamental accounting equation: $Assets = Liabilities + Equity$.Real-time Trial Balance: Generates a Trial Balance to ensure total debits equal total credits before reports are finalized.Automated Reporting: Produces instant Income Statements and Balance Sheets based on the current ledger state.2. Intelligent Data VisualizationComplex accounting data is translated into a visual dashboard for rapid decision-making:Account Composition: Features a Chart.js doughnut chart showing capital allocation across Assets, Liabilities, and Expenses.Performance Snapshots: Provides high-contrast "neon" indicators for Net Income (YTD) and total Asset values.Interactive Ledger Flow: The landing page utilizes CSS animations of a "T-Account" visualizer to symbolize real-time data processing.3. User-Centric WorkflowDesigned to minimize manual errors while maintaining professional standards:Dynamic Journaling: Supports complex multi-line (compound) entries with an "add transaction line" feature.Account Discovery: Uses searchable datalists for account selection and a "+" modal to create new accounts without leaving the journal screen.Searchable History: The Ledger view includes real-time filters and a toggle between "Detailed" and "Summary" views.4. Technical RobustnessBackend: Built with Python and the Flask framework for robust server-side logic.Persistence: Uses Flask sessions to store the Chart of Accounts and Journal Entries, ensuring portability for local use.Clean Architecture: Strictly separates logic (app.py), futuristic styling (style.css), and frontend interactivity (app.js).
